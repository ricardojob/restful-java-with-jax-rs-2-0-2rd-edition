# Chapter 4. HTTP Method and URI Matching


Now that we have a foundation in JAX-RS, it’s time to start looking into the details. In [Chapter 3](../chapter3/your_first_jax_rs_service.md), you saw how we used the **@GET**, **@PUT**, **@POST**, and **@DELETE** annotations to bind Java methods to a specific HTTP operation. You also saw how we used the **@Path** annotation to bind a URI pattern to a Java method. While applying these annotations seems pretty straightforward, there are some interesting attributes that we’re going to examine within this chapter.
