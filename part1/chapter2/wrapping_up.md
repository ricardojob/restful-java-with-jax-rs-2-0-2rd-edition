# Wrapping Up


So, weâ€™ve taken an existing object diagram and modeled it as a RESTful distributed service. We used URIs to represent the endpoints in our system. These endpoints are called resources. For each resource, we defined which HTTP methods each resource will allow and how those individual HTTP methods behave. Finally, we defined the data format that our clients and services will use to exchange information. The next step is to actually implement these services in Java. This will be the main topic for the rest of this book.
