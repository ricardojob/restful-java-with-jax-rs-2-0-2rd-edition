# Wrapping Up


In this chapter, we discussed how links and forms have allowed the Web to scale. You learned the advantages of applying HATEOAS to RESTful web service design. Finally, you saw some JAX-RS utilities that can help make enabling HATEOAS in your JAX-RS services easier. [Chapter 24](../../part2/chapter24/example_ex10_2_link_headers.md) contains some code you can use to test-drive many of the concepts in this chapter.
