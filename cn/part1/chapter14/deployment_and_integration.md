# Chapter 14. Deployment and Integration


Throughout this book, I have focused on teaching you the basics of JAX-RS and REST with simple examples that have very few moving parts. In the real world, though, your JAX-RS services are going to interact with databases and a variety of server-side component models. They will need to be secure and sometimes transactional. [Chapter 3](../chapter3/deploying_our_service.md) was a very simple example of deploying JAX-RS within a Java EE environment. In this chapter, weâ€™ll look into more deployment details of JAX-RS and how it integrates with Java EE and other component models.
