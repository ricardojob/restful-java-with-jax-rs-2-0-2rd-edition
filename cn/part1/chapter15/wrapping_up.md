# Wrapping Up


In this chapter, we discussed a few of the authentication protocols used on the Internetâ€”specifically, Basic, Digest, and Client Certificate Authentication. You learned how to configure your JAX-RS applications to be secure using the metadata provided by the servlet and Java EE specifications. You also learned about OAuth as well as digital signatures and encryption of HTTP messages. [Chapter 29](../../part2/chapter29/example_ex15_1_custom_security.md) contains some code you can use to test-drive many of the concepts in this chapter.
