# Chapter 18. Examples for Chapter 3


[Chapter 3](../../part1/chapter3/your_first_jax_rs_service.md) walked you through a very basic example of creating a JAX-RS service and a JAX-RS client that invokes on it. This service was a simple in-memory customer database. It was modeled as a singleton JAX-RS resource class and exchanged simple XML documents.



This chapter takes the code from [Chapter 3](../../part1/chapter3/your_first_jax_rs_service.md) and shows you how to run it using the downloadable workbook example code. Iâ€™ll walk you through how the code is structured on disk as well as how the examples use the Maven build system to compile, build, and run it.
