# Wrapping Up


In this chapter, you learned how deployment works within Java EE and standalone Servlet 3.x containers as well as in environments that are JAX-RS aware. We also looked at some portable ways to configure your JAX-RS applications. Finally, you saw how you can portably integrate with EJB and Spring. [Chapter 28](../../part2/chapter28/example_ex14_1_ejb_and_jax_rs.md) will allow you to test-drive some of the concepts presented in this chapter. It will walk you through the deployment of a full application that integrates with EJB, Spring, and Java Persistence (JPA).
