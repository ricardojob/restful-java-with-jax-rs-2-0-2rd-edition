# Wrapping Up


In this chapter, we discussed how to implement a simple customer database as a JAX-RS service. You can test-drive this code by flipping to [Chapter 18](../../part2/chapter18/build_and_run_the_example_program.md). It will walk you through installing JBoss RESTEasy, implementing JAX-RS, and running the examples in this chapter within a servlet container.
