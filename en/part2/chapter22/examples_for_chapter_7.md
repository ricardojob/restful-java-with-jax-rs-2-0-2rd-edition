# Chapter 22. Examples for Chapter 7


In [Chapter 7](../../part1/chapter7/server_responses_and_exception_handling.md), you learned how to create complex responses using the **Response** and **ResponseBuilder** classes. You also learned how to map thrown exceptions to a **Response** using a **javax.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper**. Since most of our examples use a Response object in one way or another, this chapter focuses only on writing an **ExceptionMapper**.
