# Chapter 28. Examples for Chapter 14



In [Chapter 14](../../part1/chapter14/deployment_and_integration.md), you learned a bit about how JAX-RS fits in the grander scheme of things like Java EE and Spring. In this chapter, there are two similar examples that define the services illustrated in [Chapter 2](../../part1/chapter2/designing_restful_services.md). The first marries JAX-RS with EJB. The second uses Spring to write our JAX-RS services. Instead of using in-memory maps like the earlier examples in the workbook, both examples use the Java Persistence API (JPA) to map Java objects to a relational database.
