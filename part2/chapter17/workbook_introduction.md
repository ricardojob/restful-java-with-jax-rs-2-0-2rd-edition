# Chapter 17. Workbook Introduction



Reading a book on a new technology gives you a nice foundation to build on, but you cannot truly understand and appreciate a new technology until you see it in action. The following workbook chapters were designed to be a companion to the main chapters of this book. Their goal is to provide step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and running various JAX-RS examples found throughout this book with the RESTEasy framework.


This chapter focuses on downloading and installing RESTEasy and the workbook examples. Following this, each workbook chapter corresponds to a specific chapter in the book. For example, if you are reading [Chapter 3](../../part1/chapter3/your_first_jax_rs_service.md) on writing your first JAX-RS service, use [Chapter 18](../chapter18/build_and_run_the_example_program.md) of the workbook to develop and run the examples shown in that chapter with RESTEasy.



This workbook is based on the production release of RESTEasy JAX-RS 3.0.5. I picked RESTEasy as the JAX-RS framework for the workbook for no other reason than I am the project lead for it and I know it backward and forward. That said, I took great care to ensure that you can easily port the examples to other JAX-RS implementations.
